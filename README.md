# push_swap
In this project, I have implemented a sorting algorithm that sorts a given stack of unsorted integers (a). It is done by determining the lowest cost for moving a node from stack b to a. Which ultimately resulted in the fewest moves.
To run the code
```
make
./push_swap [list unsorted integers]
```
